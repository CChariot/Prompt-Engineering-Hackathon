        "content": "The idea of passive income sounds pretty good, doesn't it? You exert little (if any) effort while making money. Of course, you'll need upfront money to make money. There's no such thing as a free lunch. However, once you accumulate enough cash, generating passive income can be relatively easy. Want to make $10,000 in passive income this year? Invest roughly $115,000 in these three safe high-yield dividend stocks. I think Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) is a great stock to buy with the first one-third of the initial $115,000. The company's dividend yield of 9.49% would enable you to make well nearly $3,638 in passive income this year. Ares Capital offers such a high yield primarily because of its business structure. As a business development company (BDC), it must return at least 90% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends to be exempt from federal taxes. Of course, the company must generate plenty of income in the first place to have enough to pay dividends. That's not a problem for Ares Capital. It generated net income of over $1.5 billion last year based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), more than doubling its 2022 total. Ares Capital has paid a dividend every quarter for 14 years with no cuts. The BDC's highly diversified portfolio and strategy of focusing on the upper end of the middle market lowers its risk level. CEO Kipp deVeer also recently confirmed that increasing numbers of large, high-quality companies are coming to Ares Capital for financing because of \"the stability that we provide through market cycles.\" Investing another $38,333 (one-third of the initial $115,000) in Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) could also enable you to rake in a boatload of passive income. The midstream energy provider pays a distribution that yields 8.93%. That's enough to make you over $3,420 this year. Those distributions should be highly dependable. Energy Transfer's earnings jumped 15% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $1.3 billion. The company had around $970 million in cash flow left over in Q4 after paying its distributions."

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/going-cat-mouse-game-oracle-114100614.html",
        "content": "Meredith Whitney — famously known as the \"Oracle of Wall Street\" for her forewarnings of a financial crisis back in 2007 — is confident that older homeowners will start listing their homes, opening up opportunities for hopeful young buyers across America. Whitney, the CEO of investment research firm Meredith Whitney Advisory Group, points to the cost-of-living crisis and higher consumer prices, which could lead some homeowners to cash in on their equity by selling and moving into smaller homes to enjoy a more comfortable lifestyle.

Try these 5 easy money hacks to help you make and save thousands of dollars in the new year (they will only take seconds) She believes this will lead to an excess of inventory, driving home prices down. “I say all this almost as a public service announcement in terms of, if people want to sell, be better positioned to sell earlier as opposed to later,” Whitney said in a recent interview with Business Insider. On the flipside, Whitney advises buyers to wait for prices to come down as inventory swells. “It’s going to be a cat-and-mouse game,” she says. Whitney has already foretold of a “silver tsunami” coming back in November, as millions of Americans begin to think about downsizing. Citing AARP estimates at Yahoo Finance’s Invest Conference, Whitney said 51% of people over the age of 50 are planning to downsize to smaller homes — ushering in over 30 million units into the housing market. She also believes many of these older folks will be unaffected by high mortgage rates, since they can use up the cash from selling their larger homes to purchase smaller properties, mortgage-free."

        "content": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is putting up a massive new headquarters in midtown Manhattan. But New York is no longer the state where it employs the most people. Texas is. The country’s largest bank has 31,500 employees in the Lone Star State following an expansion over the last decade highlighted by a four-building, 1-million-square-foot campus in Plano, a suburb of Dallas. That is 2,600 more than it has in New York. \"This state has been booming,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told Yahoo Finance in November during a summit with local business owners in Frisco, Texas. It’s not just JPMorgan. What’s happening at the nation’s largest lender is also playing out across the wider world of banking. Texas recently passed the state of New York in finance employment for the first time ever in a 33-year period, according to an analysis by Yahoo Finance of Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 1990 to 2023. It happened in December, when Texas had 384,900 such workers. That was 100 more than New York state. This tally counts jobs directly tied to the banking industry — like analysts, loan officers, and financial managers — and does not include the insurance and real estate sectors. The New York City metropolitan area, which includes parts of New Jersey, is still No. 1 in finance workers when compared to other metro areas. But a well-known Texas region — Dallas — has taken the No. 2 spot. The emergence of Texas as a banking center is many decades in the making. In fact, New York state has been slowly losing its grip as the dominant place for banking jobs since the years following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. That’s when some of the biggest financial institutions began shifting parts of their workforce elsewhere to save on costs and manage risks. California took over the top spot between 2001 and 2006, but a housing meltdown and the 2008 financial crisis sent employment in that state and New York tumbling again."

        "content": "The car is a charmer, for sure: A one-of-a-kind 2018 Cadillac ATS-V Sedan, finished in Black Raven with a Kona Brown interior, with less than 16,000 miles, is currently up for bid, currently at $29,000 and climbing. There’s one more spec worth mentioning: The former owner is the president of the United States. Joe Biden, before he took office, had asked Cadillac to build the car to order — note the gorgeous Kona Brown interior, the magnesium paddle shifters, the 18-inch CT4-V Blackwing wheels, the Rennick Performance exterior trim. Historically, Biden has admitted to (and bragged about) being a “car guy.” The son of a car dealership manager, the president told a gathering at the Detroit Auto Show a couple of years ago, “You all know I’m a car guy. Just looking at them and driving them, they just give me a sense of optimism.” He added, “Although I like the speed, too.” The president’s ex-sports sedan now resides at Wilmington Cadillac in Biden’s home state of Delaware, where it was turned in off-lease in March 2020, according to the dealership. As of today (Feb. 15), there are six days remaining on the Cars & Bids auction. The rear-wheel drive ATS-V model, introduced in 2016, was targeted at the BMW M3 as well as other performance cars. It featured a 3.6-liter twin-turbocharged V6 rated at 464 horsepower (0-to-60 in 3.8 seconds!), and other factory equipment, including the Luxury and Safety and Security packages and Magnetic Ride Control. The Caddy was offered as a coupe and as a sedan, and production ended after the 2019 model year. Modifications reported by the selling dealer include 18-inch CT4-V Blackwing wheels finished in Tech Bronze, a Rennick Performance front grille and rear bumper trim, a black emblem kit, a suede microfiber steering wheel and shift knob, and tinted windows (but not bulletproof glass). According to the notes on the auction site, the current dealer acquired the car four years ago and added about 3,700 miles to it. Some “minor damage” to the bumpers was repaired, and there’s a fairly complete service history as well."

Here’s how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger “The millennials and Gen Zers who are complaining that they can’t buy a house are not working minimum wage,” he says. “These are people making $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 … $90,000 a year who can no longer afford a house.” In a viral TikTok video, Smith compared the earnings of 2024 college graduates and 1980s minimum wage workers — and he discovered some thought-provoking results that may explain why young people seem so pessimistic about their options. Smith did some quick math and calculated that college graduates in 2024 spend the same percentage of their earnings on rent as minimum wage workers did back in 1980 — despite seemingly having a much greater earning potential with their college degree. In the video, he runs through his math for viewers. The median monthly rent in 1980 was $243, while minimum wage workers made $3.10/hour. Assuming they worked a 40-hour week, their monthly earnings would come in at $496. This means that 48.9% of a minimum wage worker’s income would go toward rent. As for now, Smith puts the current median monthly rent at $1,747 (he’s not far off, but it’s closer to $1,713, according to Realtor.com’s most recent numbers). A college grad makes an average of $24 per hour, meaning they earn $3,840 per month, according to statistics from the job site ZipRecruiter. This means that a typical college grad today must use up 45.4% of their salary on rent."

Getting a regular job, he explained, is only for a “worst-case scenario,” but Hammer believes Racso’s current situation couldn’t get any worse. “I’m borderline ready to kick you off,” he told him. “This is the angriest I’ve ever been.” Racso started trading cryptocurrencies in 2020 with $40,000. He eventually turned that into $440,000. Unfortunately, his day trading was fueled by immense leverage as high as 17 times his equity. That’s excessive by conventional metrics, but not unusual in the cryptocurrency industry, where platforms can offer leverage ratios as high as 125. However, excessive borrowing is a double-edged sword, as Racso eventually found out. He said he lost 70% of his portfolio when the trading platform FTX and cryptocurrency Terra/Luna collapsed in 2022. Based on his own analysis done via vedic astrology (which focuses on karma over personality traits), the events that happened to Rocso were driven by the “eclipse of Taurus and Scorpio.” The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) estimated that more than $450 billion in market value was destroyed when the Terra/Luna project collapsed, while FTX’s bankruptcy dissolved another $200 billion."

It could be that they are not willing to discuss what even their career goals are with their partner. Another one would be taking on debt and just pretending it doesn't exist. And not all debt is bad debt. It could be that you've invested in yourself, you've taken on student loans, it could be that you're saving for a big purchase and you've taken out a mortgage or maybe an automobile to drive to that job that you need to get to."

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-early-to-call-impact-of-layoffs-on-macro-economy-145756728.html",
        "content": "[A version of this article was previously published on TKer.co.] Stocks made new record highs, with the S&P 500 reaching a closing high of 5,029.73 on Thursday and an intraday high of 5,038.70 on Friday. For the week, the S&P shed 0.4%. The index is now up 4.9% year to date and up 39.9% from its October 12, 2022 closing low of 3,577.03. The strength of the stock market seems in conflict with the plethora of news headlines on companies announcing layoffs. Here are a few from just the past week: Nike to Cut Over 1,600 Jobs - The Wall Street Journal\nParamount Lays Off Hundreds of Workers - The New York Times\nCisco to lay off thousands of employees - CNN\nCleveland-Cliffs closing West Virginia tin plant, 900 to be laid off - Fox News There’s no question that this is unfortunate. It can be particularly distressing to the individuals who are directly affected. But if you’re thinking about what these headlines mean for the economy as a whole, you need a lot more context before you prematurely jump to conclusions. For starters, it’s important to understand what’s typical for layoffs across the economy. According to the most recent monthly Job Openings & Labor Turnover Survey from the BLS, employers laid off 1.6 million people in December. That’s a large number. But as the chart below shows, monthly layoffs during much of the current economic recovery have bounced around between 1.3 million and 1.8 million. During the prepandemic economic expansion, this figure trended between 1.6 million and 2 million. There’s a lot to be said about all this. Here are a few points: To get to 1.6 million layoffs, a lot of companies have to make a lot of layoffs. For example, 1,600 companies announcing 1,000 layoffs gets you to 1.6 million. That is to say, the layoffs reported in the news may just reflect an ongoing phenomenon in the economy. The 1.6 million layoffs represent just 1.0% of total employment. This layoff rate has ranged from 0.9% and 1.2% for most of the current recovery. During the prepandemic economic expansion, this figure trended between 1.1% and 1.4%. Many people who get laid off return to work pretty quickly. This is confirmed by the fact that employers hired 5.9 million people in December (This includes people who were hired after quitting jobs). Furthermore, according to BLS data, the U.S. economy has experienced net job creation for 37 consecutive months through January. The national layoff data is a bit stale as it comes on a two month lag. However, the Labor Department’s weekly tally of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits is very timely. During the week ending February 10, initial claims fell to 212,000, down from 220,000 the week prior. While this is above the September 2022 low of 182,000, it continues to trend at levels historically associated with economic growth. As I noted in the Feb. 14 newsletter to paid subscribers, while mentions of layoffs in quarterly earnings transcripts have risen recently, they’re below last year’s levels. And last year’s flood of layoff headlines did not come with a significant move in the aggregate, hard labor market data."

But after purchasing a new home in the pricey San Francisco Bay Area, he now expects it to decline to about $230,000 — which he claims is no longer enough to cover his family of four’s living expenses. Starting in September, when his daughter starts attending preschool full-time, Dogen expects the family expenses to hit $288,396 a year. Using a 24% effective tax rate, he says he’s left with $174,800 in net passive income — $113,200 short of what he’ll need in the fall."

        "content": "Based on reviews and accolades from trusted industry sources, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) produces some of the world's best electric vehicles (EVs). On the other hand, the company has had one of the worst-performing stocks of any credible player in the space. Lucid's share price is down roughly 94% from the high it reached after going public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company in July 2021. Notably, the EV specialist is gearing up to release its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, Feb. 21, and recent coverage from a Morgan Stanley analyst suggested that most of the bearish news surrounding the business has already been priced into the stock. Notably, the company is also scheduled to make a push into the SUV category with the introduction of its Lucid Gravity later this year. Is now the time to buy this heavily beaten-down EV stock? Lucid's Q4 report will provide information about the company's revenue and net loss in the period. There's also a fair chance Lucid will offer guidance on vehicle production and deliveries this year. But the company already released numbers for exactly how many vehicles it produced and delivered in 2023, and the numbers weren't pretty. Lucid produced only 8,428 vehicles last year, falling short of the company's guidance that said it would produce more than 10,000 vehicles. The shortfall looks even worse considering management had initially guided for production to be between 10,000 and 14,000 units. 2023's production number was up just 17.4% from the 7,180 vehicles it produced in 2022. Meanwhile, vehicle deliveries rose from 4,369 vehicles to 6,001 vehicles -- representing growth of roughly 37.4%. Lucid may have faced some production issues that caused it to fall short of its original targets for 2023. But there's a good chance that the company slowed manufacturing because vehicle inventory was starting to pile up. That would be in line with broader trends impacting the EV industry right now and suggests that the economies of scale needed to achieve profitability are much further out."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- As if the commercial real estate market weren’t in enough trouble already, there’s a new risk lurking in property portfolios. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Keeps NY Empire Intact as Judge Rescinds Asset-Sale Order Systemic Risk Concerns Grow Among Money Managers as Real Estate Woes Cause Turmoil Record US Stock Rally Is Under Threat From a World in Turmoil Top Investors Share the Toughest Lessons They Had to Learn UK, Allies Look to Arm Ukraine With AI-Enabled Swarm Drones Real estate companies are facing a major blow to asset valuations, as evolving European requirements drive investors and bankers to cut their exposure to buildings with a big carbon footprint. The issue has increased the possibility that property owners’ assets will end up stranded, devalued by the impact of climate regulations. “The industry at the moment is very, very aware of stranded assets,” said Neil Menzies, director of sustainability at Hibernia Real Estate Group Ltd., a Dublin-based firm owned by Brookfield Asset Management. The risk of assets being stranded is “getting greater because it’s now legislated as well.” Commercial real estate values have toppled after higher interest rates and lower occupancy levels upended the financial logic of much of the sector’s debt-reliant business model. Both the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve have made clear they’re now monitoring what lenders are doing to mitigate potential losses. Against that backdrop, Menzies says the industry is now facing a further valuation shock as it becomes clear just how much renovation and investment is needed to bring the majority of buildings across Europe up to the bloc’s new requirements around energy efficiency. The situation is so dire, according to Menzies, that he expects the market is “probably going to see values plummet over the next 12 months for unsustainable buildings with very high energy usage.” The European Union estimates that about 85% of buildings in the bloc were built before 2000. Of these, 75% have a “poor energy performance,” the EU said. The EU has set a goal of cutting emissions in the building sector by 60% by 2030 and completely decarbonizing it by 2050. At 42% of energy consumed, buildings “are the single largest energy consumer in Europe,” according to the European Commission."

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/got-1-000-buy-hot-143800249.html",
        "content": "Investors should consider adding growth stocks to their portfolio to complement the blue chip stocks that dominate major market indexes. Tech companies with excellent growth prospects and strong products can deliver returns that outpace the market over the long term, but it's important to buy shares before they launch to expensive valuations. If you're making contributions to a Roth IRA for last year, these two stocks could be a great way to deploy $1,000 for long-term growth. Dynatrace (NYSE: DT) provides cloud-based observability, application monitoring, and analytics solutions that are valuable resources to other technology companies. That's a lot of jargon for the unacquainted, but these are important functions to ensure the effective, efficient, and secure deployment of enterprise software. That's made Dynatrace an important piece of the digital transformation trend in recent years, and the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is keeping that momentum alive. Dynatrace's products are regarded as among the best in class by rating organizations and customers.\nSome analysts assign a narrow economic moat to the business, suggesting that its competitive position could be jeopardized by capable peers. That's something to consider for the long term, but its reputation is pristine for the moment, and that's unlikely to change in the short term. The quality is evident in recent financial results. Dynatrace impressed Wall Street over the past few quarters with strong earnings reports that topped analyst expectations and the company's own internal forecasts. Its most recent quarter delivered 21% growth in both revenue and annual recurring revenue (ARR), which measures contractually obligated subscription revenue. Dynatrace is on pace to deliver $150 million of net profits and nearly $350 million in free cash flow for the full year. This builds on multiple straight years of consistent revenue growth that's translating to higher cash flows, and there's no sign of weaker demand around the corner."

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-warren-buffett-stock-buy-144000483.html",
        "content": "As the markets continue their upswing, there are plenty of stocks out there hitting new all-time highs. Given the general negative market sentiment just a year ago, this may have seemed unlikely, but the broad-based indexes continue to perform. The S&P 500 is now trading above 5,000 and is already up 5.4% just in 2024. While the broader market is doing well, not all stocks have rallied to the same degree. Take Ally Financial (NYSE: ALLY), for instance. The online bank has seen some investor hesitancy over the last few quarters as investors were concerned about various regional banking sector uncertainties, rising interest rates, and the company's exposure to the less-than-favorable automotive loan market. Its largest shareholder is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which owns close to 9% of the company (as of Dec. 31, 2023). Share prices of Ally Financial are off roughly 36% from their all-time highs, trading for approximately $36 a share. Is it time to buy the dip and ride with Buffett? Let's investigate further and see how cheap Ally Financial stock truly is. Ally was born out of the Great Recession in 2008 when General Motors sold off its financial subsidiary, GMAC -- as part of efforts to get out from under a bankruptcy filing. GMAC then changed its name and began its evolution into a full-fledged consumer bank. Its connections with many auto dealerships around the United States helped it keep its auto loan operations. Car-related loans still make up over half of the assets on its balance sheet. The automotive-lending operations didn't drastically change when Ally Financial was formed, but it had to develop a whole new business muscle: consumer banking. Starting from scratch after the advent of smartphones, Ally made the wise decision to become an online-only bank with zero physical branches. Today, this allows the company to run with lower overhead costs and offer customers high interest rates on their checking and savings accounts."

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-2-billion-reasons-buy-144500461.html",
        "content": "After sales dipped 2.8% in its fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was finally able to return to growth in the latest quarter as revenue increased 2.1%. The tech titan also reported a 13% jump in net income, showing once again how profitable of an enterprise this is. Through the ups and downs, investors by and large have remained positive. The top FAANG stock has soared over 40% since the start of 2023 as investors have sought to ride the momentum of strong returns. One notably positive number stood out -- 2.2 billion -- providing good reason to buy Apple shares. However, one critical metric should give investors pause. Here's what you need to know about the iPhone maker. Shareholders and analysts undoubtedly focus on key figures like revenue, margins, free cash flow (FCF), and how well different products, such as the iPhone, MacBooks, and iPads, sold in any given period. These are certainly important numbers that can help one understand Apple's success. But there's one data point that truly demonstrates the sheer dominance of this business. \"I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices,\" CEO Tim Cook said on the first-quarter 2024 earnings call. This figure was up from about 2 billion just six months ago. And it continues to rise with each passing quarter. Not only does this represent how successful and ubiquitous Apple has become, but it also indicates how powerful of an ecosystem the company has built. There are 2.2 billion devices out there all using Apple's various software and subscription solutions, which produce a very profitable (73% gross margin) revenue stream. And this division was able to grow sales at a faster clip than hardware in the latest fiscal quarter, which is an ongoing trend. Investors looking to own stocks for the long haul should want the businesses to have durability. With its massive installed base that keeps getting larger, Apple fits the bill here. These are loyal customers who understand how great the products and services are."

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-airbnb-stock-hand-over-145400466.html",
        "content": "Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) reported its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 13, and both revenue and management's guidance were better than what Wall Street was expecting. This top travel stock is up almost 16% year to date as of this writing, and it has climbed about 85% since the start of last year, far exceeding the broad market. But with shares still sitting 27% below their peak price, should you buy Airbnb hand over fist with $1,000 right now? During the last three months of 2023, Airbnb's revenue increased 17% year over year to $2.22 billion. While its growth has slowed from prior quarters, that double-digit pace is still impressive, especially when you consider the uncertain macroeconomic environment. It looks like consumers are still ready to spend on travel and experiences, though, as Airbnb reported more than $73 billion of gross bookings last year. The company produced adjusted EBITDA of $738 million in Q4, beating the analysts' consensus estimate of $645 million. Of course, for a business that's still in growth mode, investors should pay attention to the consistency of profits. Management's outlook call for the top-line to grow 13% (at the midpoint) to $2.05 billion in the current quarter. This, too, was more than Wall Street was expecting. Before buying any company's stock, investors should look for the presence of an economic moat. This is a concept the great Warren Buffett popularized, referring to a characteristic or a set of characteristics that can be expected to provide a company with durable advantages that allow it to outperform rivals and fend off new competitors over an extended period. Airbnb's moat stems from powerful network effects. The company operates a two-sided platform that only becomes more valuable as it grows. Its services are available in 220 countries and regions across the globe. The company counts over 5 million hosts and 7.7 million listings. And there were 99 million nights and experiences booked last quarter. This clearly demonstrates Airbnb's massive scale."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Trading activity in fuels is surging the most in years as a listless crude market pushes investors to seek money-making opportunities in more niche products. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Keeps NY Empire Intact as Judge Rescinds Asset-Sale Order Systemic Risk Concerns Grow Among Money Managers as Real Estate Woes Cause Turmoil Record US Stock Rally Is Under Threat From a World in Turmoil Top Investors Share the Toughest Lessons They Had to Learn UK, Allies Look to Arm Ukraine With AI-Enabled Swarm Drones While crude has drifted in a $10 band this year, fuel markets have been roiled by attacks in the Red Sea, refinery outages and heavy maintenance, a deep freeze in the US and Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries. The end result is one of the most active trading periods for refined products in several years. “Traders are betting on product differentials performing as an expression of their view, rather than outright crude prices,” said Greg Newman, chief executive officer of Onyx Capital Group. “Summer products have performed consistently over the last few years, so are being seen as a safe bet.” The number of money managers holding positions in Europe’s benchmark diesel contract rose to the most since 2021 last week, and the US diesel contract also achieved a similar milestone. Trading activity is booming as well, with the surge showing up in the three most active fuels contracts: CME Group Inc.’s gasoline and heating oil futures, as well as Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s gasoil futures. ICE says gasoil volumes are up almost 40% from a year earlier, while CME says average heating oil volumes have risen more than 20% and gasoline activity is also higher. The bonanza is also spreading into some of the oil market’s most esoteric corners. For example, the difference between diesel prices in Europe and Asia — a measure known as the east-west spread, which is traded on ICE — saw huge swings and traded a record volume in January. The activity was driven by refinery disruptions in Europe as well as the surging cost of freight as ships sailed thousands of miles around Africa to avoid attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels in the Red Sea."

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/celsius-stock-reach-100-2024-150000393.html",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite has done well for investors in recent years. Since February 2019, the tech-heavy benchmark has returned 120%, including dividends. That's impressive. But I think investors would struggle to find a business that has done better for shareholders than Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH). The beverage stock has skyrocketed more than 5,000% in the last five years, a monster gain. Bullish investors are hoping that the momentum continues. In the same vein, can Celsius stock reach $100 by the end of 2024, translating to a return of 60% from the current share price? There's absolutely no question that the company is benefiting from tremendous growth. In the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Celsius reported sales of $385 million, which were 105% higher than the year-ago period and more than 10 times higher than Q3 2020. It's easy to get excited about this type of expansion. This isn't a software company. No, Celsius sells energy drinks that mix essential vitamins and minerals with caffeine. By branding itself as a health-focused beverage choice, the business has experienced outsized success. There are important developments that bode well for Celsius' future. The company inked a partnership deal with soft drink and snacks giant PepsiCo in August 2022. Pepsi took an equity stake in Celsius, and it became its distribution partner both domestically and internationally. This could seriously broaden Celsius' brand awareness, which can work wonders for a consumer-facing product. Additionally, Celsius has found tremendous success selling on Amazon. This energy drink is now the most popular on the massive e-commerce marketplace, ahead of rivals Monster and Red Bull. Amazon had 4.5 billion visitors to its website in January, traffic that can drive greater sales for Celsius. Wall Street analyst estimates call for revenue to rise 38% in 2024 compared to last year. Given this strong momentum, I don't think it's out of the realm of possibilities for the shares to reach $100 by the end of this year. Of course, this depends on the current price-to-sales ratio of 12.8 not dropping considerably."

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-best-magnificent-seven-stocks-151100710.html",
        "content": "The returns of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have trounced the returns of the growth-centric Nasdaq Composite index over the last year, and they continue to do so in 2024. Year to date, the group has returned 12.4%, almost doubling the Nasdaq's returns, based on the performance of the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF. Among this elite group of tech stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are showing solid business growth and still offer upside from their recent highs. Here's why these two Magnificent Seven stocks remain solid picks right now. Nvidia has been one of the best stocks to ride the growth in artificial intelligence (AI), as its share price soared by 239% over the last 12 months. The good news for investors late to the party is that its skyrocketing growth may have a while to play out. The stock remains attractively valued relative to its underlying business growth, and it's still one of the best AI stocks to buy for a few reasons. One technique for getting a read on end-market demand for a company's products is to look at what other companies with adjacent businesses are reporting. Super Micro Computer makes plug-and-play rack systems for data centers, which include Nvidia's GPUs. Supermicro reported that its revenue grew 103% year over year in the most recent quarter as demand grew for AI rack solutions based on Nvidia's H100 chip. This was a massive acceleration over Supermicro's previous quarter and suggests demand for Nvidia's chips is not slowing down. Analysts are raising their annual revenue estimates for Nvidia for the next few years, even though growth expectations were already sky-high for the GPU leader. The stock's modest valuation still makes Nvidia an attractive stock to buy. It currently trades at 35 times next year's consensus earnings estimate, which looks reasonable given Nvidia's robust growth. There is $1 trillion worth of data center infrastructure to fuel Nvidia's growth for a long time."

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roku-best-streaming-stock-buy-152000617.html",
        "content": "Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) recently reported its financial results for the last three months of 2023. And based on how shares are performing, investors weren't pleased with the numbers. Revenue was better than expected, but management warned of ongoing industry headwinds this year. The latest update proves again that Roku is dealing with an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. And this will continue to impact the digital advertising market in the near term. Nonetheless, the business is still well positioned to gain from the growing number of cord-cutters. But is Roku the best streaming stock to buy right now? Let's take a closer look. The best way to understand Roku's business model is to think of it as a three-sided platform, consisting of viewers, content providers, and advertisers. Viewers use the service as a way to enjoy all of their favorite movies and TV shows in one elegant interface. And advertisers who want to target a large, highly-engaged streaming audience can do so with Roku. While the company does generate revenue from the sale of its hardware devices, including smart TVs and media sticks, the vast majority of its top line comes from the platform segment. This advertising and subscription revenue made up 86% of the total in 2023. With the leading smart-TV operating system in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, Roku has 80 million active accounts that streamed 29.1 billion hours of content last quarter. What places Roku in an advantageous position is that it can ride the wave of streaming entertainment, while other companies spend tens of billions of dollars to produce this content. And as marketing dollars transition from traditional cable TV to connected TV, the business will benefit from greater digital advertising spend as well. Shares have soared 77% since the beginning of 2023, but they're still 85% below their all-time high. They also trade at a price-to-sales multiple of 2.9, just a fraction of the historical average of 10.1. This beaten-down valuation helps support the argument that Roku might be the best way to play the streaming trend."
